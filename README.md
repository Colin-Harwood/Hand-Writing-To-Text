# Numbify
<hr/>
<h3>Numbify is a fullstack website utilising Bootstrap and React for the front end, Django as the full stack aplication and finally a custom made neural network with tensor flow for the predictions.</h3>
<h3>Once a user has drawn their number and pressed the 'Find Number' button the image is sent to the api which preproccesses the image and then runs it throught the model, where the result is then given to the frontend to display with simple Javascript.</h3>
